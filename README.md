# COVIDPapers
This repository conatains papers from my time at the Infectious Diseases Modelling team of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), formerly Public Health England (PHE) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some of these papers I was involved with, and others were linked due to the talks I've given.
