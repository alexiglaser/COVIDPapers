# COVIDPapers
This repository conatains papers from my time at the Infectious Diseases Modelling team of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), formerly Public Health England (PHE) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some of these papers I was involved with, and others were linked due to the talks I've given.

The following are only available online:

[The rapid replacement of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant by Omicron (B.1.1.529) in England](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abo5395) (Growth rate plots)

[Understanding an evolving pandemic: An analysis of the clinical time delay distributions of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257978)

[Transmission dynamics of monkeypox in the United Kingdom: contact tracing study](https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj-2022-073153)

Though the last paper is about mpox it, along with the prior paper, deal with time delay distribution modelling and how to deal with coarsely collected data.
